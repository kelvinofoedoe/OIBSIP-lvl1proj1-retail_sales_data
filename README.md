Explore Istanbul's shopping scene with our dataset from 10 malls (2021-2023). Demographics, invoices, products, and more provide insights for researchers and analysts.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Portfolio Project**
In this project, I embarked on a journey of comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable patterns and trends within the dataset. Leveraging a combination of statistical techniques, visualization tools, and strategic thinking, I meticulously scrutinized the data to extract actionable insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions with confidence.

**Approach:**
My approach to EDA is rooted in a structured yet flexible methodology. I began by thoroughly understanding the objectives of the analysis and the nature of the dataset. This initial step involved data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the integrity and quality of the data. By addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, I laid a solid foundation for meaningful analysis. The dataset came clean and there was need for further data cleaning.

**Techniques and Tools:**
I delved deep into the data to uncover hidden patterns and relationships. I employed the most suitable methods to derive meaningful insights. I used SQL to query the dataset to gain insights. I also leveraged Tableau to transform raw data into intuitive visualizations, making complex concepts accessible to stakeholders.

**Key Contributions:**
Through my rigorous analysis, I unearthed key insights that drove strategic decision-making across various domains. Whether it was identifying market trends, understanding customer behavior, or optimizing operational processes, my EDA efforts provided valuable guidance to stakeholders. Based on my analysis, I found the following insights:

1. Women emerged as the primary consumers across all ten shopping malls.
2. The top-selling categories of items were clothing, cosmetics, and food and beverages.
3. Cash emerged as the predominant payment method utilized across all ten malls.

**Recommendations:**
 By empowering stakeholders with actionable insights, I facilitated data-driven decision-making that led to tangible outcomes. From driving revenue growth to enhancing efficiency and productivity, the ripple effects of informed decisions were evident across the board. Based on the insghts, i recommended
1. Targeted Marketing Strategies: Develop targeted marketing campaigns aimed at women to capitalize on their status as the primary consumers. Tailor promotions, advertisements, and product displays to appeal to their preferences and interests.
2. Diversify Product Offerings: Given that clothing, cosmetics, and food and beverages are the top-selling categories, consider expanding the range of products within these categories. Introduce new and trendy items, collaborate with popular brands, or offer exclusive deals to attract more customers.
3. Payment Method Flexibility: While cash remains the preferred payment method, consider offering additional payment options such as credit/debit cards, mobile payments, or online transactions. This can accommodate a wider range of customers and streamline the checkout process.
4. Regular Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor sales data and customer feedback to gauge the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Adjust marketing tactics, product offerings, and operational procedures based on insights gained to ensure sustained growth and customer satisfaction.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, my exploration of data analysis showcases my skill in turning raw data into useful information. By blending statistics, strategic thought, and visualization skills, I've shown how data insights can lead to success in organizations. As I keep improving my abilities and exploring new areas in data analysis, I stay dedicated to creating value and making a real difference.
